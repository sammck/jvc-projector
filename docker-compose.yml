# docker-compose.yml configuration for a simple HTTP service container
# that sits behind traefik running in a tp_hub environment and provides
# a REST API for control of a JVC projector on the local LAN.
#
# See https://github.com/sammck/tp-hub for more information about tp_hub.
#
#  Environment Variables:
#    APP_NAME                   The app name used for the path prefix  ("http(s)://hostname>/${APP_NAME}/"). Defaults to jvc-projector
#
#    JVC_PROJECTOR_HOST         The hostname or LAN IP address of the JVC projector. Required, because SDDP
#                               will not work behind Docker's NAT.
#
#    JVC_PROJECTOR_PASSWORD     The password used to authenticate requests to the JVC projector.
#                               If ommitted, no authentication is required.
#
#   === Variables below are provided by Portainer when launched on tp_hub, and do not need to be added to launch environment variables ===
#
#    SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME
#                               The fully qualified public DNS domain that the private-only shared apps will run on.
#                               If launched by Portainer on tp_hub, this variable is provided by Portainer's own
#                               environment, and does not need to be added to launch environment variables.
#
#    SHARED_LAN_APP_CERT_RESOLVER
#                            "prod" or "staging".  The certificate resolver to use for ${SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME}
#                               If launched by Portainer on tp_hub, this variable is provided by Portainer's own
#                               environment, and does not need to be added to launch environment variables.
#
#    HUB_HOSTNAME               The linux hostname of the hub host machine. Used as a host name match for HTTP
#                               path-based routing on the LAN only.
#                               If launched by Portainer on tp_hub, this variable is provided by Portainer's own
#                               environment, and does not need to be added to launch environment variables.
#
#    HUB_HOSTNAME2              Alternate hostname of the hub hostname. Normally this is "${HUB_HOSTNAME}.local".
#                               Used as a host name match for HTTP path-based routing on the LAN only.
#                               If launched by Portainer on tp_hub, this variable is provided by Portainer's own
#                               environment, and does not need to be added to launch environment variables.
#
#    HUB_LAN_IP                 The LAN IP address of the hub host machine. Used as a host name match for HTTP
#                               path-based routing on the LAN only.
#                               If launched by Portainer on tp_hub, this variable is provided by Portainer's own
#                               environment, and does not need to be added to launch environment variables.

# This stack serves:
#
#    http://<any-hostname>/${APP_NAME:-jvc-projector}           (private LAN only)
#
# This stack serves:
#    http://${SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME}/${APP_NAME:-jvc-projector}     (private LAN)                     (path-based, handled by <common-lan-local-hostname> router; see below)
#    https://${SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME}/${APP_NAME:-jvc-projector}    (private LAN only)                (path-based)
#    http://<common-lan-local-hostname>/${APP_NAME:-jvc-projector}    (private LAN only)                (path-based, multiple hostnames accepted; see below)
#
#    Where <common-lan-local-hostname> is one of:
#       ${SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME}
#       ${HUB_HOSTNAME}
#       ${HUB_HOSTNAME2}
#       ${HUB_LAN_IP}
#       localhost
#       127.0.0.1
#
#   The path-based routes all strip off the "/${APP_NAME:-jvc-projector}" URL" prefix before forwarding to the jvc-projector service; the stripped
#   prefix is passed on in the "X-Forwarded-Prefix" header. This technique is useful for routing a single DNS name to multiple services that
#   would otherwise collide in the URL paths that they serve. It should be noted that in many cases the service itself must be configured to
#   handle the X-Forwarded-Prefix in order to work correctly (e.g., to add the prefix back in when returning link URLs or redirects).
#   In this case, the --root-path option is passed to uvicorn.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Prerequisites common to all stacks (only done once when traefik is initially set up):
#     * Traefik should be configured with entrypoints as follows:
#            lanweb         HTTP reguests coming in from the intranet through <this-host-lan-ip>:80. Not reachable from internet.
#            lanwebsecure   HTTPS reguests coming in from the intranet through <this-host-lan-ip>:443. Not reachable from internet.
#     * traefik should be configured to proxy requests to backend service containers through docker network "traefik"
#

  #    traefik.http.services.<service-name>.loadbalancer.server.port=<custom-port>
